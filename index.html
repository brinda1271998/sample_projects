	He could be frivolous, romantic and anguished. He could go into the depths, talk about the wonder and magic of life."
	KK believed that it was unimportant for a singer's face to be seen, but "a singer must be heard". 
	In a 2019 interview, he said that he felt comfortable with a microphone but awkward in front of a camera. KK valued and "fiercely" protected his privacy.
